            <h1>About PRB</h1>
            <hr />
            The PRB department is a combination of PR and business. The PRB
            departmentsupports the rest of the team by managing and raising
            the team’s money, organising and participating in outreach and
            community events, applying for awards, and managing the team’s
            social media and website.

            <h1>Fundraising</h1>
            <hr />
            In order to raise money for the construction of our robots and
            the entry fee for competitions, PRB organises fundraisers such as
            spaghetti feeds, bake sales, and garage sales. Along with these
            fundraisers, PRB also works to get sponsorships from various
            companies to help fund the team.

            <h1>Spirit & Logos</h1>
            <hr />
            Each season, the PRB department designs new branding for the
            team depending on that year’s game theme. This often includes
            a new logo and new robotics clothing. PRB also organizes spirit
            related activities at competitions although this usually involves
            the entire team.
