            <h1>About Fabrication</h1>
            <hr />
            Fabrication, the largest department of the team, designs, prototypes,
            and builds the physical frame of the robot.They are responsible for designing and
            building the drive base as well as all game-specific mechanisms on the robot such
            as an intake or shooter.

            <h1>Brainstorming & Prototyping</h1>
            <hr />
            Fabrication along with the rest of the team begins each season by reading the
            game manual and brainstorming ideas for various parts of the robot. After 
            deciding on a set of ideas, the team begins building prototypes of each design. A
            prototype is a mock up of a certain design that can be easily built and tested.

            <h1>Designing & Building</h1>
            <hr />
            Once an idea has been agreed upon, members of the fabrication department then
            create a model of the robot and all of it’s mechanisms using 3D drawing software
            (<a href="https://www.onshape.com/" target="blank">OnShape</a> in our case). This
            process helps the team to visualize the robot and further work out any problems
            with the design. Fabrication then begins the process of building the robot, usually
            starting with the drive base. As the robot is constructed, fabrication works in
            parallel with other departments to attach electronics and load code onto the robot
            when possible.

            <h1>Pit Crew</h1>
            <hr>
            At competition, a small group of members from fabrication, electrical, and 
            programming work in the team’s pit to prepare the robot for matches and fix
            problems with the robot when necessary. The pit crew also includes a safety
            captain who must be in the pit while it is in use in order to ensure that members
            are following proper safety precautions.
